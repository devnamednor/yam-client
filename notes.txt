1. Not important at the moment but the request body may need to validated against the content type
 - if contentType is defined as json then the request body string will need to be validated if its a json string. Same applies for xml

2. First Release will support json only and no file upload

3. VS code extension or a new app may be needed  but for now the focus will be on building cli application for simplicity.

4. Requests will need to be processed parallel in future but initial Release will not support that.

5. Support Get and Post get and post initial release
